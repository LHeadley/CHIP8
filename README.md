# CHIP-8 Interpreter 

An interpreter for the [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) programming language, utilizing SDL2 for audio, input and graphics. Currently, only support for the original COSMAC VIP CHIP-8 is planned, but other variants may be added in the future after the base is done.
